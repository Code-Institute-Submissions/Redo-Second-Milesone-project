-   ### Design
    -   #### Color Scheme
        -   The main colors used are white(elegance), blue (welcoming and trusted), grey(cutting edge) and orange(knowledgeable).
    -   #### Typography
        -   I just used the main font of Arial for a clean and simple look with a back up font of sans-serif. 
    -   #### Imagery
        -   All of the starting cards have a starting image of a gold bar showing a very elegant item behind the card. Behind each card is a luxury brand and its correlating pair that switches spots each time the game starts over.
